# easyCrypt

easyCrypt is a simple webapp built using python's Gradio and cryptography libraries. This webapp allows for a simple yet safe way to encrypt and decrypt Office and text files.

## How to set up

### Clone GitHub repository

```
  git clone https://github.com/nordiel/easyCrypt.git
```

### Once inside the project folder

Initialyze a python virtual enviornment

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

- python3 specifies Python 3. If your system's Python 3 executable is just python (common on Windows), you can use:

  ```
  python -m venv .venv
  ```

### Install dependencies

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Now that you're all set up, run the `main.py` file and in the console you will find the gradio localhost url or head to http://127.0.0.1:7860 if project is run correctly.
